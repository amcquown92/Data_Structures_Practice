## Notes from Python Review
Strings are immutable, once created they cannot be transformed, can be copied or altered into new variables.
Strings are objects. String methods alwauys return new obejcts.
### The `in` operator
Using in with two strings gives a boolean result based on whether (or not) the first operand is a substring of the second
### List methods
